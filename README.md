# Simple WordPress Accordion Block

This plugin is a simple accordion for the WordPress Gutenberg block editor, consisting of two blocks: the accordion container, and the accordion-row. The accordion-row block is a child block of the accordion container, and can be added as many times as you'd like. The accordion-row block can contain any content that you'd like, and the accordion container can be styled with CSS.

## Installation

You can install this plugin from the repository by downloading the zip file and uploading it to your WordPress site. If you edit the plugin, you'll need to run `npm install` and `npm run build` to compile the JavaScript and CSS with your revisions.

## Usage

Once installed, you'll see a new block in the Gutenberg editor called "Accordion". As is, the block is very simple, but it's a good starting point for more complex accordion blocks. The styling is very basic, and is intended to be overridden by your theme or edited and compiled with the plugin.
