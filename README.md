# Simple WordPress Accordion Block

This plugin is a simple accordion for the WordPress Gutenberg block editor, consisting of two blocks: the accordion container, and the accordion-row. The accordion-row uses inner blocks to allow for any content to be used inside the accordion.

## Installation

You can install this plugin from the repository by downloading the zip file and uploading it to your WordPress site. If you edit the plugin, you'll need to run `npm install` and `npm run build` to compile the JavaScript and CSS with your revisions.

## Usage

Once installed, you'll see a new block in the Gutenberg editor called "Accordion". You can add as many accordion rows as you'd like, and each row can contain any content that you'd like. As is, the block is very simple, but it's a good starting point for more complex accordion blocks. The styling is very basic, and is intended to be overridden by your theme or edited and compiled with the plugin.
